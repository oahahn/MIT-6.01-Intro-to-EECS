## Week 10 - Discrete Probability

In Week 10 we looked at how to deal with uncertainty in systems and how to search the world for possible solutions to problems. We focussed on discrete probability, implementing joint and marginal distributions in Python as well as conditioning using Bayes rule. Below are descriptions of the Python scripts I implemented during this week. 

*  distribitutions.py:
	*  Includes a class that represents a discrete probability distribution as a dictionary with relevant methods such as marginalizing out a variable or conditioning on a variable.
*  joint.py:
	*  Uses the probability distribution class to implement joint distributions, marginal distribtutions and Bayesian reasoning.
