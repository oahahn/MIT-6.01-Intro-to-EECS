## Week 1 - Object-Oriented Programming

Week 1 focused on abstraction and modularity. In particular, we looked at how object-oriented programming provides methods for capturing common patterns in data and the prodcedures that operate on them via classes, generic functions and inheritance. Below are descriptions of the Python scripts I implemented during this week. 

* polynomial.py:
	* Implements a polynomial class which provides methods for performÂ­ing algebraic operations on polynomials. These include multiplicative expansion, printing in common math format, evaluating the polynomial and finding its roots.
* library.py:
	*  This script implements a class to represent a library. The library class is meant to model a library which stores books which can be borrowed. It has procedures to implement fines if books are returned after the due date. 
* vectors.py:
	*  Implements a Python class called V2, which represents two-dimensional vectors as a data strucutre. Some of Pythons in-built addition and multiplication procedures have been overwritten with vector operations.
