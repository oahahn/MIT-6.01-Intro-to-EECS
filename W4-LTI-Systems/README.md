## Week 4 - Linear Time-Invariant Signals and Systems

In Week 4, we focused on linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. We learnt how to represent LTI systems using state machines and introduced other ways to represent LTI systems. We also used linear time-invariance to analyze and predict the behavior of the system. Below are descriptions of the Python scripts I implemented during this week. 

*  constructingSignals.py:
	*  Here we used an existing implementation of signal constructors to build complex signals from primitive ones, in order to develop an intuition about how they work.
*  signalDefinitions.py
	*  Most of this code was written by the course staff. I implemented six basic signal classes at the end of the script. These will be used as the building blocks for more complex signals. 
*  composition.py:
	*  This implements a feedback system to demonstrate
